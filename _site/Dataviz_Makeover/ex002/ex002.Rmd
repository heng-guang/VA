# 1   Introduction

This data makeover is based on the bus trips data given by Professor Kam Tin Seong, downloaded from LTA Datamall and URA region, planning area and planning subzone information were added by using GIS Overlay operation.

The .shp file is also given, which contains the URA Master Plan 2014 Planning Subzone boundary map in ESRI shapefile format.

The bus trips dataset compiles the Bus Trips of Singapore for 2022 January, with additional details such as the origins and destinations. The Origin and Destination information is given in terms of Bus Stop numbers, Planning Area, Planning Regions and further broken down into Subzones as seen in the figure below.

```

# 2   Original Data Visualisation

The original data visualisation is shown below.

<center>

![Original Data Visualisation](img/orig.png)

</center>

At first glance, the chart is really confusing. I will go through why this is so.

The image below is obtained from [Ben Jones](https://dataremixed.com/2012/05/clarity-or-aesthetics-part-2-a-tale-of-four-quadrants/), an author who occasionally writes about data visualisation.

<center>

![Grid of Clarity and Aesthetics](img/quadrants.png)

</center>

We can classify any data visualisation into any of these 4 quadrants, on a X scale of **Clarity** and a Y scale of **Aesthetics**. Personally (as rating is subjective), I would put this visualisation into Quadrant III, as it is *Ugly* and *Confusing*. We break down each of the criteria, Clarity and Aesthetics, and also add an element of Interactivity, to critique.

## 2.1    Aesthetics

Aesthetics refers to how the graph looks. There are a couple of points that needs to be critiqued.


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/aesthetics.png")
```


### 2.1.1 Bar graphs are not useful for this visualisation

Bar graphs are useful tools to show the frequency or occurrence of items. For a single colour, it is assumed to be one single value. However, this bar graphs actually shows the aggregate trips for each hour and does not break down the data further into which subzone.

A stacked bar chart will be more appropriate, breaking down into the type of day and the different subzones. 


### 2.1.2 The details of the bar graphs are confusing

For a data visualisation, colour is very important to emphasise at a glance to the viewer on the key points. This graph does not have multiple colours, and hence there is no focus for the reader. Also, the x axis consists of skips in the labels, and it is not sure where it starts and ends. The axis title "Time Per Hour" will be inferred Number of Times per Hour but should actually be "Hour of Day".

Similar to above, a stacked bar chart will be better breaking down into the type of day and different subzones, with each of the categories having a separate colour to distinguish the features.


### 2.1.3 The adjacency matrix is too cluttered

As it seems like all of the data is being plot on the adjacency matrix at the same time, the static chart is hard to read properly. The figure size is too small to accomodate all of the 304 subzones and the viewer can not possibly see any details, despite the legend at the bottom right.

The adjacency matrix should be dynamic and sized appropriately based on input.


## 2.2    Clarity

The chart is also unclear on the following points.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/clarity.png")
```

### 2.2.1 The Visualisation does not contain any title

A title is supposed to convey a message to the audience. However for this chart, there is no title given. Hence, it is hard for the viewer to infer what the chart is trying to show and hence the viewer has to spend extra attention to see what is going on with the visualisation.

An appropriate chart title like "Bus Trips in January 2022 for Subzones XXXX" would be a better title.

### 2.2.2 Nothing can be inferred from the Adjacency Matrix

Since the font sizes are so small, it is not clear what the matrix is trying to show. Although a legend in greyscale is provided at the bottom right corner, none of these points are discernible on the plot and it is hard to tell one row of data from another.

The adjacency matrix should hence only show relevant information.

### 2.2.3 The bar chart title does not make sense

Chart Titles shall also be clear to inform the viewer the headings for each chart. It is not clear what "generated from" and "attracted to" means in the original visualisation, and whether there is a linkage between the two. Upon further testing, both of the charts are unrelated although the title make it seem like it is.

The chart should hence be more clear and indicate from which subzone to which subzone.

## 2.3    Interactive Design

The chart is supposed to be interactive, but falls short due to the following points.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/interactivity.png")
```

### 2.3.1 The charts do not interact with each other

Although it seems like the bar graphs are linked, the charts are actually independent. The bar charts and the adjacency matrix are also not linked, which defeats the purpose of having an interactive visualisation.

Hence, a better idea would be to synchronise the input, such as highlighting to show how each of the charts link to each other.

### 2.3.2 The adjacency matrix does not readjust based on the filters

The adjacency matrix seems to be fixed although one expects that the filters will help to adjust it to the relevant context. Furthermore, clicking on the adjacency matrix does not show anything or is too small to do so. 

A better way to incorporate interactivity is to filter the adjacency matrix based on the selected subzones.

### 2.3.3 There are too many rows for the filters

Since there are 304 subzones, it is not practical and quite ugly to include all of the subzones especially since the filter is supposed to be a single selection. 

For a single selection, a single-select dropdown list can instead be provided to reduce clutter.


# 3    Proposed Design

## 3.1 Sketch of Design

The proposed sketch is shown below.

```{r layout = "l-page", fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/VA2sketch.png")
```

For this dashboard, we will create a total of four visualisations, of which two are bar graphs. Since there is interactivity involved, we will also create a dropdown list for selecting the From subzone and a filter for To subzones. We will also add a Weekday/Weekend filter to keep in line with the intention of the original visualisation.

## 3.2 Advantages of Design

The proposed design addresses the following issues mentioned above:

1. *Bar graphs are not useful for this visualisation*

For the bar graph, a stacked bar graph is used to visualise the destinations of the subzones. For the origins of the subzones, they are segregated into Weekday and Weekends. 

2. *The details of the bar graphs are confusing*

The bar chart title will be renamed to Hour of Day, with each of the values explicitly stated. There will also be stacked graphs to show the differences in day and hour.

3. *The adjacency matrix is too cluttered*

The matrix will be simplified with the title removed, and this will adjust accordingly based on the filtered criteria. Only a single row will be shown each time.

4. *The Visualisation does not contain any title*

The key message of the visualisation will be given. It will show the audience what to expect and also how to interact with the design.

5. *Nothing can be inferred from the Adjacency Matrix*

The adjacency matrix will show the percentage of trips from the origin subzone to each of the destinations based on the filtered criteria.

6. *The bar chart title does not make sense*

A stacked bar chart will be used for both the origin and destination subzones. For the origin subzone, the data will be split into both weekday and weekends/holidays. For the destination subzones, it will be filtered based on the number of total trips.

7. *The charts do not interact with each other*

A highlighting action will be added for the viewer to see how each of the chart interacts when hovered over. The charts will be linked and this will be very clear to the viewer on how each of the chart shows the information differently.

8. *The adjacency matrix does not readjust based on the filters*

As mentioned above, the adjacency matrix will be reduced based on the filtered origin and destination subzones.

9. *There are too many rows for the filters*

For the origin subzone, only a single select option is given. This will reduce clutter and the input can be easily seen without the need for scrolling. For the destination subzone, all the rows are still needed if the user intends to deselect some of the options to check the revised % of Total Trips from the origin subzone.


## 3.3 Proposed Visualisation on Tableau

Please view the designed and proposed visualisation on [**Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/heng.guang.sia/viz/DataVisualisation2-BusTrips/Dashboard1).

# 5   Concluding Remarks and Observations

### The distribution of bus trips from the subzones are most concentrated around the center

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/les1.png")
```

From the image above, we can see a darker region around Bedok North region. This is probably due to the intra-zone bus trips such as [feeder bus services](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/getting_around/public_transport/bus_network.html) for riders trying to connect people from surrounding housing estates and industrial areas to the MRT. For trunk bus services which are inter-zones, the number of trips falls off with distance from the center of the subzone.

### There are more people who take buses on weekdays as compared to weekends and holidays

knitr::include_graphics("img/les2.png")
```

Although this is to be expected, we can see the differences in Weekdays/Weekends due to the stacked bar chart. This could be due to people taking other modes of transports such as cycling and walking as they have more time to do so, or since it is the weekends, most people are staying at home. Pooled transport also comes to mind for the weekends, for example instead of a family of four each taking their own transport to work/school on weekdays, they go for a drive together on weekends where it is more practical to do so. These bar charts help to illustrate the differences in number of trips as compared to the initial visualisation. 

### The peak in bus trips for the Outside Central Region is opposite from the Core Central Region during Weekdays


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

``` 

From both of the charts above and the chart for Bedok North, there is a large difference in shape between the AM peak hours and the PM peak hours. For the Bedok North region, the peak hours on Weekdays are from 6-8pm, presumably when most people are heading to work. However, for the Central Subzone region, most of the trips are made during 5-7pm, where people are heading home from work.
